              <summary>
                Thousands of years ago, Steppenwolf and his legions of Parademons
                attempt to take over Earth with the combined power of three Mother
                Boxes. They are foiled by a unified army that includes the Olympian
                Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, mankind, and the Green Lantern Corps.
              </summary>
              After repelling Steppenwolf's army, the Mother Boxes are separated
              and hidden in locations on the planet. In the present, the world is
              in mourning over the death of Superman, which triggers the Mother
              Boxes to reactivate and Steppenwolf's return to Earth in an effort
              to regain favor with his master, Darkseid. Steppenwolf aims to gather
              the artifacts to form "The Unity", which will destroy Earth's ecology
              and terraform it in the image of Steppenwolf's homeworld. Steppenwolf
              retrieves the Mother Box from Themyscira, prompting Queen Hippolyta to
              warn her daughter Diana of Steppenwolf's return. Diana joins Bruce
              Wayne in his attempt to unite other metahumans to their cause, with
              Wayne going after Arthur Curry and Barry Allen, while Diana tries to
              locate Victor Stone. Wayne fails to persuade Curry, but manages to
              recruit an enthusiastic Allen onto the team. Although Diana fails to
              convince Stone to join, he agrees to help them locate the threat if he
              discovers their location. Stone later joins the team after his father
              Silas, along with several other S.T.A.R. Labs employees, were kidnapped
              by Steppenwolf seeking to acquire the Mother Box from mankind. Steppenwolf
              attacks Atlantis to retrieve the next Mother Box, forcing Curry into action.
              The team receives intel from Commissioner James Gordon leading them to
              Steppenwolf's army, based in an abandoned facility under Gotham Harbor.
              Although the group manages to rescue the kidnapped employees, the facility
              is flooded during combat, which traps the team until Curry helps delay the
              flood so they can escape. Stone retrieves the last Mother Box, which he had
              hidden, for the group to analyze. Stone reveals that his father used the
              Mother Box to rebuild Stone's body after an accident almost cost him his life.
              Facing overwhelming odds against Steppenwolf's army, Wayne decides to use the
              Mother Box to resurrect Superman, not only to help them fight off Steppenwolf's
              invasion, but also to restore hope to mankind. Diana and Curry are hesitant
              about the idea, but Wayne forms a secret contingency plan in case Superman
              returns as a nemesis. Clark Kent's body is exhumed and placed in the
              amniotic fluid of the genesis chamber of the Kryptonian ship alongside the
              Mother Box, which in turn activates and successfully resurrects Superman.
              However, Superman's memories have not returned, and he attacks the group
              after Stone accidentally launches a projectile at him. On the verge of being
              killed by Superman, Batman enacts his contingency plan: Lois Lane. Superman
              calms down and leaves with Lane to his family home in Smallville, where he
              reflects and attempts to recover his memories. With the final Mother Box
              unguarded, Steppenwolf retrieves it with ease. Without Superman to aid them,
              the five heroes travel to a village in Russia where Steppenwolf aims to
              unite the Mother Boxes once again and remake Earth. The team fights their
              way through the Parademons to reach Steppenwolf, although they are unable to
              distract him enough for Stone to separate the Mother boxes. Superman arrives
              and assists Allen in evacuating the city, as well as Stone in separating the
              Mother Boxes. The team defeats Steppenwolf, who, overcome with fear, is attacked
              by his own Parademons before they all teleport away. In the aftermath
              of the battle, Bruce and Diana agree to set up a base of operations for the
              team, with room for more members. Diana steps back into the public spotlight
              as a hero; Barry acquires a job in Central City's police department, impressing
              his father; Victor continues to explore and enhance his abilities with his
              father in S.T.A.R. Labs; Arthur returns to Atlantis; Batman continues protecting
              Gotham; and Superman resumes his life as reporter Clark Kent. In a post-credits
              scene, Lex Luthor escapes from Arkham Asylum and recruits Slade Wilson to
              form their own league.
